                I stayed at the hotel which I booked through this WebSite, for
                three nights in November 2019. What an amazing hotel. I was
                greeted with such kindness and this continued throughout my
                stay. I booked the king room and my room was situated on the
                14th floor. The room was fantastic. Clean, modern, and had a
                fantastic view over the City. The rooms were absolutely
                beautiful. I can't complain about this hotel. The gym was great,
                the rooftop bar was fantastic, and all of the facilities were
                clean and modern. The restaurant located inside the hotel, was
                delicious. I dined here for breakfast and dinner.

                Hands down the best Chicken Wings I have ever eaten. My partner
                and I were finding something to eat and then we found this
                Website which totally saved our money and gave us very good
                experience. The wings themselves had great flavor and AMAZING
                crunch. But really, I think the crispiness of the wings is what
                makes the wings so good. The sauce was a balanced mix of sweet
                and spicy, which was also great over rice.

                The Hotel is located off the highway in a business, industrial
                area. It is not possible to walk to any shops or restaurants.
                One side of the hotel faces the golf course, the other side
                faces an industrial park and other buildings; request a view
                room. Lobby is large and open with a high ceiling and lots of
                seating for leisure and business. The pool, when we were there
                in June, was under construction and they were working on a
                Saturday morning. This is a convention/business hotel and at
                times the wait for the elevator was long and common areas could
                be very crowded and noisy. Soundproofing was weak, doors
                slamming, hallway noise. The executive lounge staff was friendly
              </p>

                beyond, I would give her 6 stars if I could. Best customer
